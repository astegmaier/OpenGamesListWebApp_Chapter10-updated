# OpenGamesListWebApp_Chapter10-updated
This project is an attempt to update the sample app from Valerio De Sanctis' book [ASP.NET Core and Angular 2](http://a.co/8xZfy9L) so that it uses latest beta versions of OpenIddict. The sample code in the book relies on OpenIddict 1.0.0-alpha2-0419, which is [no longer available](https://github.com/openiddict/openiddict-core/issues/390). The latest version of OpenIddict at the moment (April 2017) is 
1.0.0-beta2-0559, which includes substantial changes since the Alpha version, including the removal of the OpenIddictDbContext class.

In the process of updating, I also went ahead and moved to Angular 2.4 and Typescript 2.2.
